## Chainalytic ICON

A simpler, better, and more efficient version of link:https://github.com/yudus-lab/chainalytic-framework[Chainalytic Framework] dedicated for ICON blockchain networks.

NOTE: `Chainalytic Framework` is now deprecated and should be used only for reference and study. +
For production, you should go with this `Chainalytic ICON`

`Chainalytic ICON` is the engine for aggregating, transforming, and building new data from blockchain transactions ( also known as *transition functions* ) +
It runs in form of a "node" ( a bit similar to blockchain node ) and be composed of `Aggregator` and `Provider` service, in which

- Each *data transform* has its own database and kept in sync with one *upstream* blockchain node belong to some network ( e.g. citizen node ) +
- Provides an async JSON-RPC API for other applications to consume data.

Currently, there is only one built-in data transform `contract_history`. I will gradually port transforms from legacy `Chainalytic Framework` in the future.

Ultimately, anyone can run a *Chainalytic ICON node* for any *loopchain-based* network ( ICON mainnet, testnet, tbears, private chains...) and build new data upon their demand.

Note that, it is neither analytic framework nor platform, its main purpose is data source backend for other applications, include analytic platforms.

## Standalone usage

### Install dependencies ( Ubuntu 20.04 )
[source]
----
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-pip libsecp256k1-dev libleveldb-dev pkg-config build-essential
----

### Install `chainalytic-icon` package

[source]
----
python3 -m venv venv
venv/bin/pip install -e .
----

### Init config
[source]
----
./launch -i
----

### Start data aggregation process

_Endpoint info will be loaded from `config.yml` if missing_

[source]
----
./launch -a localhost:5500 -p localhost:5600
----

### Run monitor
[source]
----
./launch -a localhost:5500 -p localhost:5600 m
----

_Console monitoring looks like this_

image::docs/console.png[]

### Stop
[source]
----
./launch -a localhost:5500 -p localhost:5600 stop
----

### Run individual services ( for debugging )

[source]
----
venv/bin/python -m chainalytic_icon.aggregator --endpoint localhost:5500 --working_dir .
venv/bin/python -m chainalytic_icon.provider --endpoint localhost:5600 --working_dir .
----

## Production Docker `Chainalytic-ICON` node

_Just clone `sample_docker_deploy` folder in this repo and edit from there_

### Step 1

Go to your cloned `sample_docker_deploy` folder which will contain `Chainalytic-ICON` node database, then edit `docker-compose.yml` like below

[source]
----
version: '3'
services:
  chainalytic-icon:
    image: duyyudus/chainalytic-icon
    container_name: chainalytic-icon
    volumes:
      - /path/to/data/mainnet:/mainnet # Modify this, or skip if not using fast mode `direct_db_access` in `config.yml`
      - ./.chainalytic_icon:/chainalytic_icon/.chainalytic_icon
    ports:
      - 5500:5500
      - 5600:5600
----

### Step 2

Edit `.chainalytic_icon/cfg/config.yml` content, usually just need to edit `network_name`, `citizen_node_endpoint` and `direct_db_access`

[source]
----
network_name: 'icon_mainnet'

citizen_node_endpoint: 'https://ctz.solidwallet.io' # Just feel free to choose your favorite citizen node

aggregator_endpoint: '0.0.0.0:5500'
provider_endpoint: '0.0.0.0:5600'

chain_db_dir: '/mainnet/.storage/db_CHANGEIP:7100_icon_dex'
score_db_icondex_dir: '/mainnet/.score_data/db/icon_dex'

# 1 for fast reading data from leveldb, 0 for fetching block data from citizen node
direct_db_access: 1

transforms:
  - contract_history
  - stake_history

storage_dir: '.chainalytic_icon/{network_name}/db'

transform_storage_dir: '{storage_dir}/{transform_id}_storage'
transform_cache_dir: '{storage_dir}/{transform_id}_cache'

log_dir: '.chainalytic_icon/{network_name}/log'

# 10: DEBUG
# 20: INFO
# 30: WARNING
# 40: ERROR
# 50: CRITICAL
log_level: 30

transform_config:
  contract_history:

    # For efficient storage, 
    # number of txs for each contract should be is limited to latest ones
    # Set to 0 for storing all txs
    max_tx_per_contract: 1000
----

### Step 3

Run Docker compose

`docker-compose up -d`
